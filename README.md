# Highly Customizable Travel Application
### Problem Description
    Have you ever experienced a moment that you would like to travel during your vacation, but not sure about where to go?
    People often go to websites, such as https://www.tripadvisor.com/ or 
    https://www.booking.com/, to search for hotels or plane tickets when they are planning for a vacation, but the first question they always get is "Where to?". There is no feature to assist users that do not have a specific destination that they want to go.
### Application Description
    What if there is a highly customizable travel application that can help users, who do not have a specific destination, to plan their trip? 
    This highly customizable travel application will prompt users to input the dates that they want to travel, their budget, the flight duration that they prefer, the weather that they like, their purposes of this trip and how many places do they want to stop by during this vacation.
